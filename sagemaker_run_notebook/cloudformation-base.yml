# A CloudFormation template that sets up the resources you need to run 
# and schedule Jupyter notebooks using SageMaker Processing.
# 
# This creates the Lambda function "RunNotebook" and IAM roles and policies to be used. The 
# publicly named roles and policies have the region added to the end to allow the template to be run 
# repeatedly in different regions (e.g., BasicExecuteNotebookRole-us-east-1). Roles and policies that
# are used internally by the resources are given "anonymous" names by CloudFormation.
#
# One of the goals of this template is to promote secure operations by creating roles and
# policies that enable the desired features in the most minimal way. Feel free to review
# and modify these policies as appropriate for your use case.
# 
# These are the activities supported along with the roles and policies created for them:
#  
# The notebook client
#   When you want to schedule or run a notebook, you are the "client." You might use AWS primitives 
#   (like `aws lambda invoke ...`), the CLI (like `run-notebook run ...`), the Python library 
#   (like `run.invoke(...)`), or via the user interface supported in the JupyterLab extension. 
#   The client will want to run and schedule notebooks, see the status of runs and schedules, and
#   download the output of the runs from S3. 
#
#   This template creates the policy "ExecuteNotebookClient-<region>". You can add this policy to 
#   any IAM role or IAM user to give them all the permissions they need to be a notebook client.
#   (We also create an anonymous role that isn't really meant to be used but CloudFormation requires
#   a policy to be attached to a role.)
#   
# The running notebook
#
#   The notebook is run as a job in the SageMaker Processing Jobs service. There are minimum permissions
#   you need for that, as defined at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-roles.html#sagemaker-roles-createprocessingjob-perms.
#   If your notebook doesn't need any other permissions to run, you can just run it with the 
#   "BasicExecuteNotebookRole-<region>". If you want your notebook to run with more permissions (e.g.,
#   you want to access data RDS or run a job in AWS Glue), you can add the policy "ExecuteNotebookContainerPolicy-<region>"
#   to a role that has the other permissions you want your notebook to have. Note that the "ExecuteNotebookContainerPolicy-<region>"
#   has all the permissions that you need to attach the job to a VPC. If you don't want these permissions, you can remove the 
#   sid "vpcattach" from that policy.
#
# Executing the Lambda
# 
#   When the Lambda is executing, it needs permission to start the SageMaker Processing Job to run the
#   notebook and give it the role you want it to use. We create an anonymous role for the (the 
#   "LambdaExecutionRole")  and attach it to the Lambda as part of this template.
#   
# Building containers for notebook execution
#
#   Jobs run in SageMaker Processing Jobs run inside a Docker container. For this project, we have defined
#   some of the container environment to include a script to set up the environment and run Papermill on the 
#   input notebook. We provide tools to build and customize this container but working with Docker can be 
#   challenging. To help with this, the CLI has a function to use CodeBuild to build the container 
#   in a way you specify and deploy the container to ECR so it can be used in the notebook execution.
# 
#   We have created the role "ExecuteNotebookCodeBuildRole-<region>" to use when building the container
#   that has all the permissions needed to download the description from S3, run the CodeBuild job and
#   deploy the container to ECR. The `run-notebook create-container ...` command uses this role by default.
