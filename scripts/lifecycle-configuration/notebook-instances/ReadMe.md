## Lifecycle configuration for SageMaker notebook instances

This directory has a lifecycle configuration script that lets you set up the JupyterLab extension for scheduling notebooks in your SageMaker notebook instance.

To use this lifecycle configuration, perform the following steps:

1. On the SageMaker AWS console, select "Lifecycle configurations" in the left column, then choose the "Notebook Instance" tab. Create a new lifecycle configuration called `install-run-notebook-extension`. Copy the contents of `start.sh` into the "Start Notebook" script. You can leave the "Create Notebook" script blank.
2. When creating a new notebook instance, open the "Additional configuration" option in the "Notebook instance settings" and select the `install-run-notebook-extension`. You can also add this configuration to an existing notebook instance by stopping the instance, opening the instance on the console (by clicking on the instance name in the list of instances), and adding the new configuration there. Then restart your notebook instance.

For more information about lifecycle configurations, see ["Customize a Notebook Instance Using a Lifecycle Configuration Script"][1] in the AWS documentation.
